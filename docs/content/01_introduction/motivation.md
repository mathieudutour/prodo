- Web frameworks have too much boilerplate
- Adding complex behaviour to an app quickly becomes difficult and unmanageable

Prodo is designed so that the core framework is small and minimal. You can then
extend the functionality of the framework with official and third party
[plugins](./plugins.md) that easily work together. Plugins allow you to quickly
add complex functionality to your app without having to duct tape together a
bunch of solutions and libraries.

Prodo allows you to write simple and complex web apps with the same intuitive
framework.
