# V2 Framework

This repo contains the current version of v2 of the Prodo framework. It is
currently experimental and will most likely be merged into
https://github.com/prodo-ai/dogedit when it is ready.

## Architecture

- `packages/core`: The main part of the framework that handles state, actions,
  subscriptions, and connect
- `examples/`: Example apps that use the framework
